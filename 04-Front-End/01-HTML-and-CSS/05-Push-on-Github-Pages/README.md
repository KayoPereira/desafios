## Setup

We don't want to keep your profile within `fullstack-challenges` because we want to version it with `git` as a separate project. So let's copy your profile as an independent folder and jump into it:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/fullstack-challenges/04-Front-End/01-HTML-and-CSS/04-Responsive-profile
cp -r profile ~/code/<user.github_nickname>
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/profile
```

## Create the GitHub repo

You can **init**(ialize) a git repository and commit your changes.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "my profile page"
```

Then we will use the GitHub CLI (Command line interface) to create the associated GitHub repo. The GitHub CLI allows you to interact with GitHub through your terminal. For now we will be creating public repositories, but you can find more options [on the official documentation](https://cli.github.com/manual/).

```bash
gh repo create # this creates the associated repo on GitHub!
```
You will then be asked for a few different inputs regarding how you wish to create your new repository.

- First select 'Push an existing local repository to GiHub', since this is exactly what we want to do now.

- Then, we need to inform the correct file path to our project. You should already be on the right folder in your terminal, so all we need to do is either hit 'enter' or type '.' and 'enter' (. represents the current folder).

- We can then name the repository on GitHub. You can either give it a new name or hit enter to keep the same name as the local repository. You'll be asked for a repository description as well. You can describe it as you want or just hit 'enter' to keep it empty.

- We also need to determine the visibility of the repository. Use the arrow keys to select between [Public, Private, Internal]. Choose Public for now.

- You will then be asked if you want to add a remote to your local repository. This is exactly what we want to do as it will link the local repository with the remote one on GitHub, so type 'Y' and hit enter. Afterwards, hit enter once more to give your remote the standard name of origin.

- The last question is if you would like to push commits from the current branch (in our case, master) to the origin branch. Type 'Y' and you are set!

To open the GitHub repo from your browser you can run:

```bash
gh repo view --web
```

## GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a GitHub service that makes it easy to deploy any **static website** in 10 seconds (static == same content for all users). It is based on a "magic" branch, called `gh-pages`. When GitHub detects this branch, it puts your website online. Awesome right? Let's create this magic branch and push it. âœ¨ðŸŒ¿âœ¨

```bash
git co -b gh-pages
git push origin gh-pages # we push the gh-pages branch, not master!
```

Now you can visit the URL `http://<user.github_nickname>.github.io/profile/` (this is the URL built automatically by GitHub) and have a look at your masterpiece online! Share the link on Slack with your buddies.

From now and until the end of the day, you can keep working in your `~/code/<user.github_nickname>/profile` directory AND on the `gh-pages` branch. This means any updates of your profile can be pushed on `http://<user.github_nickname>.github.io/profile/` through usual git commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "make my profile prettier"
git push origin gh-pages
```

## Submit your code to Kitt

As you weren't working in the `fullstack-challenges` folder, your work hasn't been submitted on Kitt. If you want to mark this challenge as complete on Kitt you can do the following:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/fullstack-challenges/04-Front-End/01-HTML-and-CSS/05-Push-on-Github-Pages
cp -r ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/profile .
rm -rf profile/.git
git add .
git commit -m "Submitting my work to Kitt"
git push origin master
```
