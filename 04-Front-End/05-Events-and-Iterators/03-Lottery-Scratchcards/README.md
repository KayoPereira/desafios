## Background & Objectives

In front-end web development, **data attributes** are a pretty handy way to inject and store values in your HTML that you can easily access in your JavaScript.

Remember that you have already worked with attributes, such as **id**, **class**, **href**, **style**, etc. Theses are standard attributes which are used for a specific purpose. But sometimes we need to store other kinds of data in the HTML and create our own attributes to do so. This is where the **data attributes** come in.

In this challenge you will learn how to interact with these data attributes via JavaScript.

## Setup

Start by running a server and go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
