## Character Count


## Goal

![Character counter mockup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/tutorials/character_counter/character-counter-mockup.png)

Code a utility Stimulus controller to display the number of characters typed in a `textarea` in real time. We've provided the html, you will have to add the correct Stimulus attributes!


## Specs

Run the server from your terminal with:

```bash
serve
```

And visit `localhost:8000`

## Javascript controller

Before creating the Stimulus controller, don't forget to make you have the folder as well!

```bash
mkdir javascript/controllers
```

And, if things are not working after you've coded your controller.. maybe you forgot to import something? ðŸ‘€
Feel free to take a peak at today's lecture!

However, the best order to follow is:
1. Create the Stimulus controller
2. Import it in the `application.js`
3. Add a `connect` function
4. Add a `console.log` or `debugger` inside the function
5. Add the name of the controller as an attribute to an html tag
6. Check if triggers the `connect` properly
7. Start coding! ðŸš€
